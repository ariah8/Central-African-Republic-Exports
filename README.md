# Central-African-Republic-Exports
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Central African Republic Exports time series in order to select an ideal model for forecasting purposes. For this analysis we used a time series data set that contains 58 observations and 9 variables (country, code, year, GDP, growth, CPI, imports, exports, and population) for the Central African Republic. However, we only focused on the exports variable, which contains information regarding exports as a percentage of GDP from 1960 to 2017.
The Central African Republic has faced export issues, it was exporting much more during the 1970s than what they currently are. According to Wilfried Kouame, this economic decline happens because of “the formation of political and armed groups that act as roving bandits, impeding anyone from producing and investing securely,” and because the “political elites have been exploiting economic inequalities ... to undermine social cohesion [and] capitalize on local grievances.” Therefore, forecasting its exports for the next couple of years is important to see if it is expected to see further decline in exports or an increase in exports. This will allow us to see if the Central African Republic is becoming more or less reliant on exports and if its economy is improving or not.
